  			<p style="text-align: center;">Hello! My name is Sayed Aatif Jamal and I am a thirteen year old  student in St.Columba’s School.<br>
        I study in grade 8th and like playing football. I have been playing it for about two years but I am not that serious as I play it only for fun. I also like coding. I am learning how to code in Html, Css and Python and have been making a lot of progress over the past few months. <br>
        I want to be a huge game developer when I grow up. I also like playing video games like Minecraft and Days Gone. I like openworld games the most because you have a whole world to yourself and you can do whatever you want to. I also used to learn how to play a keyboard but it was hard for me to manage the keyboard along with other activities so,I dropped it and picked up drawing instead:) Now I am in my school’s Art club and I also dabble in debating,poetry and acting. I also like watching stand up comedies as they help me de-stress. I am not very much into music but I bop along whenever Alan Walker plays.</p>

  			<p>I really love animals. Since I was little, I have had this place in my heart reserved only for animals.I have had many animals as pets . I used to have fish as pets when I was little but because fish required extra care and attention, they weren’t able to last long. I also remember having birds as pets. I remember that they were all budgerigars except for a few which were finches. I used to love them dearly but they also slowly went away. Some escaped whereas some went to heaven .I have also had caterpillars and weird insects as pets too. But the animals that fascinate me the most are turtles and tortoises. They are cute little creatures which only care about food. They don’t have to worry about attending classes or doing their homework all they do is eat, swim and sleep. So I asked my parents if they could get me turtles as pets. I knew it would be almost impossible as certain species of turtles are near extinction and they wouldn’t allow to keep turtles as pets. But, there is this certain species of turtles which originally lived in Mexico but was now exported world wide. I did a ton of research and found out that keeping Red Eared sliders as pets was completely legal. I told this to my parents and they brought me a pair. I named them “Jay” and “Veeru”.(The names are completely inspired by a Bollywood movie so please don’t issue a copyright on me). I still have Jay and Veeru and they both are now three years old. At first they liked eating the market pellets that were available everywhere But, because of the lockdown, these pellets were not available so we had to try feeding them raw meat which they would eat in the wild. And now they only eat meat. The market pellets are completely ignored by them and if we don’t feed them meat, they start getting furious. There have been certain occasions when they got sick. One was during the winters of the year 2020 when I woke up to find Jay’s eye completely swollen. I watched more than a 100 videos on youtube and came to the conclusion that it was because of the deficiency of Vitamin A.That immediate moment I realized it, I started crushing carrots with my bare hands to make a thin mixture of carrot juice and water. I soaked both of them in it every single day and after a few days, his eyes were open and his swelling was gone (“his” because I am never not to confirm their gender. Probably female ) I even made them a huge diy enclosure on our roof. I made it myself using bricks and cement. I don’t know why no one believes it but I worked really hard on it and I have the PROOFS. I have always wanted to make stuff that helps humanity. Even when I was little, I used to make drawings of trucks that could automatically pick up garbage while recycling it and drones that could easily put out a fire within seconds. </p>

        <hr>
        <p> My family has always donated a lot to charity and I guess that is what has helped me learn the whole value system. My father has supported charities and has participated in campaigns whereas my mom has always donated a part of our income to the poor. My mom has her own school and every year she organizes a charity program. When I grow up I want to be really helpful and kind. I want to end all kinds of discrimination forever but I can never do it alone. I will need many people who share the same thoughts as I do. I want to make this world a better place to live in. I want to make this world a place where each and every person is on the same level, where it does not matter whether a person is rich or poor or if a person is white or black. Even I have participated in some charity events. Every year I make a charity box in which I collect money and by the end of the year I along with my family donate the money to orphans or poor people. I believe that each and every person on this planet has his or her own power with which they can do anything.

        <h4 class="text-capitalize"><kbd>Astronomy + Coding == Fun </kbd></h4>	
        <hr>
        <p> I am also interested in astronomy. It feels so weird that there is something infinite which we have termed the space. It consists of millions of planets as big as the sun or as small as a country. It consists of billions of stars and billions of asteroids out of which we can barely see a handful with our naked eyes all thanks to global warming. I also love coding. When I start coding and get a good result, I feel good. It feels as if I did something. As I slowly progress through this world, I am able to relate technology with the codes that I write. I am able to understand how we can perform huge tasks within seconds and how huge machines work with small lines of code embedded into them. I love coding in python whereas HTML and CSS come on the second spot. I have many more interests for example taekwondo, poetry and drama but I won’t be able to explain them all here. Lastly, I would like to mention that everything I have been able to achieve and do so far has been made possible only because of my extremely supporting and helpful family. Apart from my super duper helpful and understanding parents, I also have two elder sisters who are always ready to help me when I need new ideas or want something done.
